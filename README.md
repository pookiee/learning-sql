This will be a place to hold my 

Begginging to learn SQL. I have compelted the khan academy, and code academy sql classes which I thought were sufficient to teach the basics. I then moved onto https://github.com/tthibo/SQL-Tutorial  which taught basically the same stuff but without pseudo code and it was on an actually sql database program SQLITE which I will be using since I don't wanna buy mySQL or microsoft sql server. 

SQLITE is pretty good at basically everything basic except large datasets and client interactions. And for my data sets I've choosen small datasets because when I imported a larger set of about 10,000 entries it crashed my computer. So I will use data sets that won't crash my computer https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets
